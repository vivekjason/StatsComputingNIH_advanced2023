## **What is this workshop?**

This workshop advances the groundwork for addressing key practical aspects of programming and other essential computer skills needed for both research and implementation of statistical methods. The course offers advanced data wrangling and data visualisation, as well as an exploration of both survival analysis and survey-based analysis in R.

## **Getting started**

Have a look at the schedule below and download the necessary .qmd files for each session. Slides are also provided. While I have included solutions- it would be way more beneficial to attempt these yourself first. Lets try to maximise learning in the next two days.
