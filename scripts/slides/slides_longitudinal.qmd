### Longitudinal studies

-   Record incident events

-   Ascertain exposure prospectively Identify time effects: cohort, period, age

-   Summarize changes over time within individuals

-   Offer attractive efficiency gains over cross-sectional studies

-   Help establish causal effect of exposure on outcome

### Time is of essence

Help establish causal effect of exposure on outcome

-   Cross-sectional study

    -   Egg → Chicken Chicken → Egg

-   Longitudinal study

    -   Bacterium → Dinosaur → Chicken

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Challenges

-   Account for incomplete participant follow-up

-   Determine causality when covariates vary over time

-   Choose exposure lag when covariates vary over time

-   Require specialized methods that account for longitudinal correlation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Analytic approach

::: callout-caution
Must account for correlation due to repeated measurements over time
:::

Failure to account for correlation ⇒ incorrect standard estimates, resulting in incorrect confidence intervals and hypothesis tests

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Analytic approaches

Approaches: Include all observed data in a regression model for the mean response and account for longitudinal correlation

Generalized estimating equations (GEE): A marginal model for the mean response and a model for longitudinal correlation

![](images/paste-8C68BB7C.png)

Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM): A conditional model for the mean response given subject-specific random effects, which induce a (possibly hierarchical) correlation structure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Generalised estimating equations

-   Contrast average outcome values across populations of individuals defined by covariate values, while accounting for correlation

-   Focus on a generalized linear model with regression parameters β, which characterize the systemic variation in Y across covariates X

-   Longitudinal correlation structure is a nuisance feature of the data (Liang and Zeger, 1986)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Generalised estimating equations

Mean model

-   Primary focus of the analysis

    Assumptions

    -   Observations are independent across subjects

    -   Observations may be correlated within subjects

-   Characterizes a marginal mean regression model

    -   µij does not condition on anything other than xij

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Generalised estimating equations

Covariance model

-   Longitudinal correlation is a nuisance; secondary to mean model of interest

    -   Assume a form for variance that may depend on µij

    -   Select a model for longitudinal correlation with parameters α

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Correlation models

Correlation between any two observations on the same subject.

-   Independence: is assumed to be zero

    -   Always appropriate with use of robust variance estimator (large n)

-   Exchangeable: is assumed to be constant

    -   More appropriate for clustered data

-   Auto-regressive: is assumed to depend on time or distance

    -   More appropriate for equally-spaced longitudinal data

-   Unstructured: is assumed to be distinct for each pair )

    -   Only appropriate for short series (small m) on many subjects (large n)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Semi-parametric

-   Specification of a mean model and correlation model does not identify a complete probability model for the outcomes

-   The \[mean, correlation\] model is semi-parametric because it only specifies the first two moments of the outcomes

-   We estimate β and generate valid statistical inference, while accounting for correlation by constructing an unbiased estimating function

-   This is also known as the sandwich, robust, or Huber-White variance estimator

    -   Requires sufficiently large sample size (n ≥ 40)

    -   Requires sufficiently large sample size relative to cluster size (n m)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GEE in a Box

-   Primary focus of the analysis is a marginal mean regression model that corresponds to any GLM

-   Longitudinal correlation is secondary to the mean model of interest and is treated as a nuisance feature of the data

-   Requires selection of a 'working' correlation model

-   Lack of a likelihood function implies that likelihood ratio test statistics are unavailable; hypothesis testing with GEE uses Wald statistics

-   Working correlation model does not need to be correctly specified to obtain a consistent estimator for β or valid standard errors for β, but efficiency gains are possible if the correlation model is correct

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Issues

-   Accommodates only one source of correlation: Longitudinal or cluster

-   GEE requires that any missing data are missing completely at random

-   Issues arise with time-dependent exposures and covariance weighting

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mixed-effects models

-   Contrast outcomes both within and between individuals

-   Assume that each subject has a regression model characterized by subject-specific parameters; a combination of

    -   Fixed-effects parameters common to all individuals in the population

    -   Random-effects parameters unique to each individual subject

-   Although covariates allow for differences across subjects, typically cannot measure all factors that give rise to subject-specific variation

-   Subject-specific random effects induce a correlation structure (Laird and Ware, 1982)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assumptions

-   Valid inference from a linear mixed-effects model relies on

-   Mean model: As with any regression model for an average outcome, need to correctly specify the functional form of xijβ (here also zij bi )

    -   Included important covariates in the model

    -   Correctly specified any transformations or interactions

-   Covariance model: Correct covariance model (random-effects specification) is required for correct standard error estimates for β

-   Normality: Normality of ϵij and bi is required for normal likelihood function to be the correct likelihood function for yij

-   n sufficiently large for asymptotic inference to be valid

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GLMM in a Box

-   Mixed-effects models assume that each subject has a regression model characterized by subject-specific parameters; a combination of

    -   Fixed-effects parameters common to all individuals in the population

    -   Random-effects parameters unique to each individual subject

-   Estimation and inference can focus both on average outcome levels and trends, and on heterogeneity across subjects in levels and trends

-   Subject-specific random effects induce a correlation structure

-   Parametric likelihood approach permits use of likelihood ratio test, but requires several assumptions that must be verified in practice

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Issues

Interpretation depends on outcomes and random-effects specification

GLMM requires that any missing data are missing at random

Issues arise with time-dependent exposures and covariance weighting

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GEE vs GLMM

#### Model Purpose

-   **GEE**: Focuses on the average population response. Good for estimating average effects in the population.

-   **GLMM**: Describes both the average population response and subject-specific deviations. Useful for both population-level and subject-specific effects.

#### Correlation Handling

-   **GEE**: Accounts for correlations between repeated measurements but doesn't model them explicitly. Uses a working correlation matrix.

-   **GLMM**: Models the correlation using random effects, considering the variance and covariance structure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GEE vs GLMM

#### Estimation

-   **GEE**: Uses quasi-likelihood estimation. Robust against incorrect specification of within-subject correlation.

-   **GLMM**: Uses maximum likelihood (or its variants) for fixed and random effects.

#### Interpretation

-   **GEE**: Provides insights about average population effects.

-   **GLMM**: Insights on both population average effects and individual variations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### GEE vs GLMM

#### Assumptions

-   **GEE**: More flexible regarding response variable distribution. Fewer assumptions on random effects.

-   **GLMM**: Assumes random effects follow a distribution, typically normal.
